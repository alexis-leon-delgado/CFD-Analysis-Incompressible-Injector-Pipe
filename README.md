# CFD-Analysis-Incompressible-Injector-Pipe
 Study of incompressible flow inside an injector pump by means of OpenFoam software. The geometry of study consists of an Y pipe formed by two inlets and one outlet. The entering flow will mix together under turbulent conditions, and its behaviour regarding velocity and pressure will be analysed.
 
The resulting flow behaviour (velocity streamlines) can be observed in the following image:
