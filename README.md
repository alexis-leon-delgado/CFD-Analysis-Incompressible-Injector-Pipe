# CFD-Analysis-Incompressible-Injector-Pipe
 Study of incompressible flow inside an injector pump by means of OpenFoam software. The geometry of study consists of an Y pipe formed by two inlets and one outlet. The entering flow will mix together under turbulent conditions, and its behaviour regarding velocity and pressure will be analysed.
